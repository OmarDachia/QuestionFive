5.	WAP to enter marks of a student in 5 subjects & calculate the percentage.

Percentage means a number or a ratio expressed in terms of fractions of 100. It is denoted using the percentage sign “%”. The abbreviation used to represent the percentage is “pct” or “pc”. In other words, the percent or the percentage is defined as how much of one quantity is made by the different quantity, and it is evaluated at about 100.

How to Calculate Percentage Using Formula
We can use the formula to calculate the percentage easily and quickly. The formula to calculate percentage is equal to the ratio of the actual value to the total value multiplied by 100. The percentage formula is:

Percentage=((Actual Value)/(Total Value))*100

How to Calculate Percentage of a Number
It is possible to calculate the percentage in three simple steps. They are:

Step 1: Identify the original form of the number, i.e. fraction or decimal. The original format will define the following mathematical operation on the number. Suppose a decimal number is 0.25, which may be the calculated ratio of the values we are comparing, while an example of a fraction is 4/15.

Step 2: Perform the mathematical operation on the number. That means, if the given number is a fraction, convert it to a decimal number. If the given number is a decimal number, then leave it as it is. 

For example, 4/15 = 0.267

Step 3: Multiply the result obtained in the previous step by 100 and the resulted value should be expressed as a percentage. For example, 0.267 × 100 = 26.7%.

Alternative Method:

We can also calculate the percentage of a number by changing the number into a fraction with the denominator 100. This can be understood in a better way from the example given below:

Example: 

Convert 3/20 to a percentage.

Solution:

The given fraction is 3/20.

Let us convert the denominator to 100.

(3/20) × (5/5) = 15/100

Now, multiply the result by 100.

(15/100) × 100 = 15

Therefore, 3/20 = 15%

Note: This method of calculating the percentage is applicable only when the denominator is a factor of 100. Otherwise, we can use the regular method to calculate the percentage.

How to Calculate Percentage of Marks
Most of the students get a question on how to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in exams. Here is the answer to this question along with the example. Two simple steps give you the percentage of marks. They are:

Step 1: Divide the obtained marks by the maxim marks of the test.

Step 2: Multiply the result by 100.

Go through the example given below to understand the process of finding the percentage of marks.

Example 1: A student scored 1156 marks in the examination out of 1200 marks. Calculate the percentage of marks secured by the student.Go through the example given below to understand the process of finding the percentage of marks.

Solution:

Number of marks scored = 1156

Maximum marks = 1200

 
 
Percentage of marks =(1156/1200) × 100

Percentage= 0.9633…. × 100

Therefore, the percentage of marks obtained is 96.3%

How to Calculate Percentage Change
Let’s learn how to calculate the percentage difference between two numbers. The percentage difference is the variation in the value of a number or quantity over a while in terms of percentage. 

The formula gives Percentage change (Or Percentage difference) is:

% change =[(Change in Value) / Original Value] × 100

Here, 

Change in Value = New value – Original value

The change in the value could be positive or negative. Positive difference means there is a percentage increase in the value, otherwise, it is called percentage decrease.
